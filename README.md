# [Anchor Template Generator Angular demo](https://deadlyfingers.github.io/ng-anchor-templates/) ![CI](https://github.com/deadlyfingers/ng-anchor-templates/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.2.

## Demo instructions

This demo app previews anchors generated by an anchor template filled with named value sets and unnamed values or a combination of both.

- Named sets are single values wrapped in `{}`
    eg. `{colors}`
- Unnamed sets can contain multiple values and are wrapped in `[]` and delimited by `,`
    eg. `[uk, united kingdom]`
- Unnamed sets can also include named sets
    eg. `[uk, united kingdom, {regions}]`

Try entering an anchor:
```
the quick {colors} [fox, foxes] jumped over the [lazy dog, {dogs}]
```

> This one anchor template will generate 24 anchors for previewing.

## Named Value Sets

Currently named value sets are provided from a static [json file](https://github.com/deadlyfingers/ng-anchor-templates/blob/main/src/app/anchors/test/named-value-sets.json).
